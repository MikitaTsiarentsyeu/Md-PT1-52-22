# Homework rules

1. All tasks should be placed in a student's own folder under a proper cataloging system, like
```
Tasks/Terentiev/TaskN/taskN.py
```
There will be cases when a task should be implemented in a several files, they should be named accordingly to the task's specifications.

2. A 100 point score is assigned to each newly uploaded task.
3. The score could be decreased according to the following list of sins:
  - **commiting directly in the main branch** will result in a **10 points penalty**;
  - **using any non-alphanumeric symbols except for the / or _ or - in a name of a branch** will result in a **10 points penalty**
  - **naming a file/branch in russion** will result in a **30 points penalty**;
  - **using a russion word in a file** will result in a **2 points penalty _for each usage_**;
  - **a missing part of a task** will result in a **20 (or more) points penalty** depending on the size of the part;
  - **a logical mistake** will result in a **15 points penalty**;
  - **a structural mistake** will result in a **20 points penalty**;
  - **a break of a convention** will result in a **5 points penalty**;
  - **a non-optimal logic of any part of a solution** will result in a **5 points penalty**;
  - **a controversial or unwise choice** will result in a **1 points penalty**;
4. The score can be increased for every usage of **the concept that was not mentioned on our lessons** at the moment. **Each usage** will result in a **5 point increase** _if said usage contributes to the logic of a program_.
5. Considering the previous point, **it's possible to go over a 100 points score**. Every surplus points will go to a personal accout of the student with possibility to **enhance any score for any task** with the account's points (***but not a score for the final project or the final grade itself***).
6. Any task could be reworked and proposed for re-evaluation at any time.
